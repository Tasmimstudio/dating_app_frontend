## 📝 My Recommendation

**Start with Option A (Maximum Impact):**

Implement these 4 features in the next 2 hours:
1. ✨ Swipe animations (cards fly away)
2. ⏳ Loading skeletons (no blank screens)
3. ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts (← → ↑ keys)
4. 📊 Profile completeness bar (motivates users)

These give immediate "wow" factor with zero backend changes needed!

Then we can tackle backend-dependent features as APIs become ready.

**Sound good?** Let me know and I'll start coding! 🚀
